Page 2 of the Security Vulnerabilities Dashboard provides a time-based and predictive view of vulnerabilities across multiple years. Here's a detailed breakdown of what this page shows:

The table shows a month-wise breakdown of vulnerabilities across 2021, 2022, and 2023, plus yearly totals:

2021: 1,050 vulnerabilities
2022: 850 vulnerabilities
2023: 1,450 vulnerabilities

Forecast by Year:

It shows the growth in the total number of vulnerabilities year over year.

Past Data:
2021: 1.1K
2022: 1.9K
2023: 3.4K

Forecast:
The line extends into 2024 and 2025, predicting a continued upward trend.
A shaded band represents the confidence interval (range of uncertainty), indicating that Total vulnerabilities may reach around 5K–6K by 2025.
This helps security teams plan ahead and forecast resource allocation for vulnerability management.

Key Takeaways:
1. Vulnerabilities have increased year over year, especially in 2023.
2. The forecast suggests this trend will continue, requiring proactive mitigation strategies.
3. Certain months (like June and May of 2023) see spikes—possibly due to release cycles, audits, or major updates.
